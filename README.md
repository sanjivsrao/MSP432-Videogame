# MSP432-Videogame
The purpose of this project was to develop a set of minigames to be played on the Texas Instrumentâ€™s MSP432P401R Launchpad microcontroller. This was done in order to garner knowledge about interfacing with the microcontroller board through GPIO, timers, ADC with the joystick, and working with the LCD screen.
